      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>Over the course of my studies in Computer Science and Data Science, I've acquired a comprehensive set of
        skills. In my Computer Science major, I've honed my programming abilities in languages like Python, Java, and
        C++, and delved deep into algorithms, data structures, and computer architecture. I've gained a solid
        understanding of how operating systems function, the intricacies of databases, and the nuances of networking.
        Additionally, through various group projects, I've developed essential soft skills, including teamwork,
        effective communication, and project management.

        On the other hand, my Data Science major has equipped me with a robust foundation in statistical analysis, data
        visualization, and machine learning. I've become adept at cleaning and preparing data, ensuring it's primed for
        analysis. My exposure to big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark has been particularly enlightening.
        Moreover, I've mastered various domain-specific tools depending on the project's requirements, whether that
        involves deep learning or natural language processing. Importantly, I've learned to communicate complex
        data-driven insights effectively, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

        In essence, my academic journey has made me a versatile and well-rounded individual, ready to tackle challenges
        in both Computer Science and Data Science domains.</p>

    <!-- Work Experiences Content -->
    <div class="main-content" id="workExperiencesContent" style="display: none;">
      <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
      <p>Over the past 5 years, I've established myself as a freelance Photoshop editor, catering to a diverse clientele
        ranging from individuals to businesses. My journey in this field began out of a sheer passion for visual
        storytelling, and soon, what started as a hobby transitioned into a full-fledged profession.

        Most of my work revolves around enhancing and retouching photographs, ensuring they meet the aesthetic and
        quality standards set by my clients. Whether it's restoring old photos, creating dynamic advertisements, or
        simply perfecting a portrait, I've done it all. My clientele often commends my attention to detail, my ability
        to understand their vision, and the creativity I infuse into every project.

        In addition to basic editing, I've also undertaken complex assignments that involved compositing multiple
        images, creating digital art, or designing marketing collateral from scratch. Being a freelancer has also honed
        my skills in client communication, time management, and self-discipline.

        The rapidly evolving world of digital art means there's always something new to learn. Thus, I've consistently
        kept myself updated with the latest Photoshop techniques, plugins, and industry trends. This commitment to
        continuous learning ensures that I provide contemporary and top-notch services to my clients.

        In summary, my freelance journey in Photoshop editing has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. Every
        project presents a new opportunity to create and innovate, and I'm deeply passionate about bringing my client's
        visions to life through my expertise. I'm excited about the future projects and the myriad of possibilities they
        present.</p>
